Connect computer via Ethernet
Enable Wake-on-LAN and disable Deep Sleep in BIOS
Make sure there's no network firmware missing
    Use 'ping [some address]' to check
    'Network unreachable' means the computer isn't connected
    Broke something?
        Try editing /etc/NetworkManager/Networkmanager.conf and changing 'managed=false' to 'managed=true'
        Then as root run 'systemctl restart NetworkManager'
        It tells NetworkManager to take over control from a possibly misconfigured ifupdown and reset up your network
Source: I also had no internet after logging in with G
Install ethtool and run '/usr/sbin/ethtool [adapter name]'
    Find adapter name with 'ip link'
        You can also find MAC address here
    'Supports Wake-on:' must have g in it
        'pumbg' is ok
Add to the global interface config file (/etc/network/interfaces):
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
            ethernet-wol g
    Possibly:
    auto eth0
      pre-up /usr/sbin/ethtool -s eth0 wol g
Turn off the computer, a light by the ethernet port should stay on
Wake it!
The computer has to have been properly shut down to wake.

Use Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Page Down (KDE Plasma Desktop) to shut down with a keyboard from the desktop
